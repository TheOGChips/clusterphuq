# clusterphuq
A cluster computer made up of Raspberry Pi 4s.

# Current state of the project
This is project is still very basic at this point. The PDF walkthrough will currently get you far enough along to have a working Raspberry Pi cluster with an NFS (network file system), MPI, and SLURM. I followed along to another tutorial, but have only had time to make it through the first part. The walkthrough will be updated as necessary and will be cited below as well as in the walkthrough. The basic idea will be that one could either follow along step-by-step through the tutorial without any automation (for the full experience), or they can use the automation scripts to (hopefully) simplify the process.

# Automation
The Bash script for setting up a static Ethernet IP address is an example of how some parts of this process can be automated. The potential for more automation will be examined once I've finished the source tutorial and updated the PDF walkthrough following that.
